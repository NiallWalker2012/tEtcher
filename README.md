# tEtcher 
tEtcher is a terminal based ISO flasher designed to have the speed of cli commands like dd, but also an easier UI  
It is inspired by well-known ISO flashers like dd and BalenaEtcher

# How to use  
tEtcher uses the rust cargo package manager. You will need to copy the first time installation file and run it in the terminal.  
A run file is attached so you can run it easily    
If you are on Windows, enter 'chmod +x "win_run.bat" in the terminal and then "./win_run.bat"  
If you are on Linux macOS, enter chmod +x "shell_run.sh" and "./shell_run.sh"  


# Dependancies 
As tEtcher is made using the Cargo rust compiler and package manager, you will need to install cargo before running  
In most cases, the terminal will tell you how to install cargo if you just enter cargo / cargo --version  


In the future I will integrate a verification option that verifies that the ISO on your computer matches the flashed image on the USB
