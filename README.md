# tEtcher (not complete)
tEtcher is a terminal based ISO flasher designed to have the speed of cli commands like dd, but also an easier UI  
It is inspired by well-known ISO flashers like dd and BalenaEcther

# How to use  
tEtcher uses the rust cargo package manager. You will need to copy the first time installation file and run it in the terminal.  
Once you have done that, you can just run it through the 'normal_installation.sh/.bat'
